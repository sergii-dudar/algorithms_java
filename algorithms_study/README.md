# algorithms study

## Algorithms copied from book `Algorithms, 4th Edition` sources of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

### I made it just to be able to made better structure for myself (to be able to navigate faster and more comfortable for me) during read\study\exercices of this awesome book, and to be able to make some changes, personal tests, logs and similar changes and share it only for myself between many machines that I'm using.
